# 🚀 Learning Through TryHackMe

Welcome to my collection of writeups and notes from my journey through [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), where I’m learning cyber security day by day.

This repo is part of my personal learning journey as I build towards a career in cyber security. Everything here reflects what I’m working through — from beginner rooms to more advanced challenges.

## 🤝 Why This Repo Exists

I'm not just doing this to learn for myself — I'm building a record I can share with others who are starting out, and eventually with employers to show my practical learning and dedication.
